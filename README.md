# Open Links App

> I originally created this as a simple tool to open multiple URL links that I've saved in a text file at once. For now, this tool only works in Windows 10 (not sure about the other Windows version) and can only open Chrome browser, it can be opened as incognito mode.    

> My initial idea was to create a tool that can export all the URL links from your browser to your chosen text files, then re-open all or specfic range of lines of the URL links to the browser later. If you don't want to bookmark around 10 web pages but don't want to miss it or can't leave it in history either. So here it is, one click and all the desired web pages are opened for you in Chrome as incognito mode, you can hide your text file in somewhere secret. 

> Again, this tool can only open URL links to the browser, not saving the URL links from the browser (yet). So you have to manually copy your URL links to a text file before you can use this tool to open it. 

> I created this tool for fun only and to learn JavaFX.

### How to use it
- Simply fork the project on your own branch
