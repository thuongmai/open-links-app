# Open Links App

> I originally created this as a simple tool to open multiple URL links that I've saved in a text file at once. For now, this tool only works in Windows 10 (not sure about the other Windows version) and can only open Chrome browser, it can be opened as incognito mode.    

> My initial idea was to create a tool that can export all the URL links from your browser to your chosen text files, then re-open all the URL links to the browser later or specfic range of lines. I really don't like the bookmarking thing in the browser, like having to re-open every single bookmarking link. So here it is, one click and all the desired web pages are opened for you in Chrome as incognito mode.

> Again, this tool can only open URL links to the browser, not saving the URL links from the browser (yet).  

### How to use it
- Simply fork the project on your own branch
- For other users who just want the tool, click on `Open-Links-App.jar`, then click `Download` button. That's all you need
